Lichadonisia or Lichades (Λιχαδονήσια) is a utopian complex of small, serene, deserted islands in Northeast Evia. This unspoiled archipelago is a picturesque treasure with emerald waters and lush, green landscapes.

Very reliable, thermal winds blow every evening here. The flat islands create a huge flat area to be expored by kite.
